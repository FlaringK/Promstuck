      <h2>Face Painting</h2>

      <div class="flex align">

        <img src="./assets/facepaintguidelines.webp" alt="">

        <div>

          Want to come in face paint? Of course you do, it's a Homestuck fan event! We have a few strict guidelines for body paint so everyone can have a good time without making a mess:

          <ol>
            <li>Paint must be SEALED and limited to the face and neck only, which means only gloves and/or armsocks (or bare/nothing) will be allowed on your arms. Absolutely no body paint on your hands whatsoever.</li>
            <li>All face paint will be gently smear checked at the door to prevent transferring to other people, decor, or the venue. We will not touch your face for you- we will provide tissues and ask that you smear check for us. </li>
            <li>We will provide setting spray and powder for those who fail the initial smear check. </li>
            <li>Bathrooms are easily accessible in the hallway outside of the venue for makeup resealing or reapplication- just ask the staff at the door to direct you!</li>
          </ol>

          The dress code is not strict, but the face paint code will be. Letâ€™s make sure we keep this event as fun as possible, with no messes, so that everybody can have an amazing time in their cosplays and outfits and so the venue can be cleaned up easily! Thank you!
